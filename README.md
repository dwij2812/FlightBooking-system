# About FlightBooking-system
Welcome to the project FlightBooking-system.
This is a webapp used to book flight using a material UI and save user time as much as possible while booking an air ticket.
This is done by keeping into records the user details and the user preferences for his flight so that he need not go through the hassles of booking a flight ticket again and again every time.

# Idea Behind
This Project was started with a vision to provide the best UI which is user-friendly and the user need not give those irritating details while travelling every time.
Instead he can just provide A-Z of it while travelling and the ticket is booked for the user in under 6 clicks only, similarly cancelling or viewing is also simple, just log in and you are done!!
